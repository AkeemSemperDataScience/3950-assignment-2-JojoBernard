        "Some notes that will be important:\n",
        "<ul>\n",
        "    <li>The total compensation will need to be constructed, there is a column for salary, \"Yearly brutto salary (without bonus and stocks) in EUR\", as well as a column for bonus compensation, \"Yearly bonus + stocks in EUR\".\n",
        "    <li>Some categorical variables will need some work, and there isn't generally an exact answer. The main concern is things with categories that have a bunch of values with a very small count. For example, if there is only 1 person in City X, then that value likely needs to be addressed. We don't want it encoded into a new column of one 1 and thousands of 0s.\n",
        "    <li>There is an article exploring some of the data here: https://www.asdcode.de/2021/01/it-salary-survey-december-2020.html\n",

        "    <li>Initial accurracy, and potentially final accuracy, may not be great. When I made a plain model will little optimization the errors were large and the R2 was low. There is lots of room for optimization.\n",
        "    <li>Research challenge - try some work on the target, look into TransformedTargetRegressor and see if that helps. Recall in stats when we had skewed distributions... Maybe it helps, maybe it doesn't.\n",
        "    <li>EDA and data prep are up to you - you'll probably need to do a little exploring to figure out what cleanup is needed. When I did it, I did things kind of iteratively when I did it. For example, look at the value counts, figure out how to treat the different categories, clean something up, look at the results, potentially repeat if needed. After you figure out what needs to be done, you may be able to take some of those steps and incorporate them into a pipeline to be cleaner....\n",

        "<b>The biggest challenge here is translating the data into something useful and clean. This will probably require a bit of exploration, examining the data, thinking about what it means, trying something, then making a model to see what the results are. In particular, think about what value some of the less clean bits of data my hold - binning/grouping, numerical transformations, outlier removal, etc... are all likely to be useful somewhere. You almost certainly need to look at it column by column and make a decision, I'll apologize up front, it isn't the most fun process in the world. There is not one specific correct answer.</b>"

        "\n",
        "### Here's the Data Cleaning Steps I Used\n",
        "\n",
        "To prepare the dataset for a regression model, I performed several iterative cleaning steps to handle the \"noise\" inherent in survey data:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Target Construction:** I created a `Total_Compensation` variable by adding \"Yearly brutto salary\" and \"Yearly bonus + stocks\". Since many respondents left the bonus field blank, I treated those as  rather than dropping the rows, as it's common in tech for base salary to be the primary compensation.\n",
        "* **Numeric Extraction:** Columns like `Total years of experience` and `Number of vacation days` contained mixed strings (e.g., \"1,5\", \"10+\", \"30 (unlimited)\"). I wrote a regex function to extract the first numeric instance and convert it to a float, ensuring \"1,5\" became .\n",
        "* **Aggressive Outlier Removal:** Initial EDA showed salaries ranging from  to billions. I filtered the data to only include total compensation between  and . I also capped `Vacation_Days` at  to remove entries where people likely entered their total remaining leave or made a typo.\n",
        "* **Handling High Cardinality:** Columns like `City` and `Position` had hundreds of unique values. I grouped any category with fewer than  occurrences into an \"Other\" category. This prevents the \"curse of dimensionality\" when one-hot encoding, as it avoids creating a column for a city that only appears once.\n",
        "* **Imputation:** Within the pipeline, I used `SimpleImputer` with the `median` strategy for numeric values and a `constant` \"Unknown\" value for categorical features to ensure no data was lost during the prediction phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Here's my Tuning/Feature Selection Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "I tested multiple configurations to find a balance between model complexity and generalizability:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Feature Engineering:** I created a feature called `Other_Tech_Count` by splitting the string of \"Other technologies\" and counting the elements. The hypothesis was that knowing more auxiliary tools correlates with higher total compensation.\n",
        "* **Model-Based Feature Selection:** I used `SelectFromModel` wrapped around an `ExtraTreesRegressor`. This automatically calculated feature importances and removed features that didn't contribute significantly to the variance. In my final run, this reduced the feature space from over  encoded columns down to the top  most impactful ones.\n",
        "* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** I used `GridSearchCV` to test `n_estimators` () and `max_depth` (). I found that a `max_depth` of  helped prevent the model from overfitting on specific survey responses.\n",
        "* **Target Transformation:** I implemented a `TransformedTargetRegressor` using a  function. Because salary distributions are typically right-skewed, predicting the log-space allows the model to minimize relative errors rather than absolute errors, which improved the stability of the  score.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Here's my Model's Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "The final model settled on was a **Random Forest Regressor** with a log-transformed target.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Final  Score:**\n",
        "* **Final Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**\n",
        "\n",
        "While an  of  might seem low in a laboratory setting, it is quite standard for raw salary survey data where \"human noise\" (negotiation skills, specific company budget differences, and unobserved variables) accounts for a large portion of the variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Here's my Final Conclusion on What Worked Best\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Ensemble Methods over Linear Models:** Simple Linear Regression failed completely (negative ) because the relationship between experience and salary is non-linear and highly dependent on categorical interactions (e.g., a Senior in Berlin vs. a Senior in a small town).\n",
        "* **Log-Scaling the Target:** This was the single most impactful change for stabilizing the model. It prevented the regressor from being overly influenced by the higher-end salaries in the dataset.\n",
        "* **Grouping \"Rare\" Categories:** Without binning the small cities and obscure job titles into \"Other,\" the model suffered from massive overfitting, as it would try to create specific rules for single individuals.\n",
        "* **Cleaning is  of the Work:** The jump in accuracy from the raw data to the cleaned version was far greater than the jump from a standard Random Forest to a tuned one. Handling the \"dirty\" strings in the experience columns was essential for the model to have any mathematical basis for prediction."
